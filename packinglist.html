	To begin geocaching you just need a GPS device, something to write with, and a 
	sense of wanderlust. But this is also the perfect opportunity to build an outdoor and 
	navigation-oriented carry. You'll be traveling outside braving the elements, so being 
	prepared should be a priority! We've made a list below on essential items you should pack 
	before your next geocaching expedition.

		<h1 id="WB">Waterproof Backpack</h1>
		<p>Keeping your geocaching carry dry should be a priority, so a waterproof bag is a no-brainer. 
		This Chaos Ready backpack has 3 main compartments protected by heavy-duty 500D PVC tarpaulin 
		for your everyday carry and more. It also comes with adjustable, padded straps to ensure a 
		comfortable carry during longer caching sessions.</p>
		
		<h1 id="PJ">Packable Jacket</h1>		
		<p>An extra layer of protection is always a good idea for when the weather takes a turn for the worse. 
		Columbia's Watertight II is easy to pack—it can fold in on itself into one of its pockets for compact 
		carry—and weatherproof thanks to its nylon and polyester construction. Zippered pockets also ensure 
		their contents stay out of harm's way.</p>
				
		<h1 id="WBb">Water Bottle</h1>
		
		<p>Staying hydrated is essential when walking around for long periods, so a quality water bottle has to 
		make it into your kit. We liked the Takeya ThermoFlask for its long-lasting insulation, functional cap, 
		and its convenient ways to carry.</p>
		
		<h1 id="FAK">First Aid Kit and Skin Protection</h1>
		
		<p>The farther out you go looking for caches, the more crucial first aid can be in an emergency. This first 
		aid kit comes in a lightweight, waterproof package so its contents stay dry until needed.</p>
		
		<p>Skin and lip protection shouldn't be overlooked either, especially when the sun and wind tend 
		to beat down in your area. Be sure to bring a lip balm and sunscreen when heading out. And if you need 
		a little help organizing all of this in your bag, check out our guide to pouch organizers for some ideas.</p>
		
		<h1 id="MT">Multi-tool</h1>
		
		<p>Nothing like a multitool to deal with any issue your bare hands can't. Leatherman's latest, the Signal, 
		features 19 essential tools, including outdoor-focused functions like a safety whistle and ferrocerium rod for 
		starting a fire in a pinch.</p>
		
		<h1 id="HL">Headlamp</h1>
		
		<p>A headlamp keeps your hands free when opening up caches. Nitecore's HC30 is one of their most rugged and powerful 
		headlamps, offering up to 1000 lumens and 162 meters of power. You can use it with either a rechargeable 18650 
		battery or 2 CR123As, and it's rugged enough for outdoor trips thanks to its IPX-8 waterproof rating.</p>
		
		<h1 id="BP">Battery Pack</h1>
		
		<p>You can't find those caches when your GPS device is out of power! Check out some high-capacity battery packs to keep 
		the hunt going. Pro tip: Download offline maps of the areas you'll be visiting to save on battery life!</p>
		
		<h1 id="GPS">GPS Navigator</h1>
		
		<p>There are plenty of mobile apps you can use to download and look for geocaches, but going old school with an 
		actual GPS navigator is still an option (especially in places where your phone has no signal!). Garmin's eTrex 10 
		is light on the price but has the features you need to get you started, such as being able to download 
		geocaching-related files and information.</p>
		
		<h1 id="SHG">Sunglasses, Hat, and Gloves</h1>
		
		<p>While lip balm and sunscreen can protect exposed areas of your body, the rest of it could use some help with 
		cooling and protection. Pack high-visibility sunglasses, a moisture wicking cap, and rugged gloves to cover your 
		bases when handling caches.</p>
		
		<h1 id="RPN">Rugged Pen and Notebook</h1>
		
		
		<p>Most geocaches will contain a pencil and logbook so you can record your find, but you should also be ready to take down your own 
		notes about the journey. Or, even leave a note behind for the next adventurer coming your way. Pilot's Down Force pen is lightweight 
		and inexpensive, and will give you a good grip even while gloved. Pair that with an all-weather Rite in the Rain notebook so a 
		little wet won't wash your notes away.</p>
